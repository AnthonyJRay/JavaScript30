## Project 1

If you use _.play()_ on an audio element, it waits for the audio to finish before being able to play again.

When you have an Array of elements, you cannot attach an EventListener to it. You must instead loop through the Array and attach an EventListener to each individual element.

JavaScript has a 'transitionend' you can use in an Event Listener, to control elements under the conditions of when it's transition has finished.

## Project 2

transform-origin changes where the pivot point it. By default it is set to 50%.
100% = Right Side
0 = Left Side

## Project 3

CSS Variables can be changed with JavaScript. Whereas with SASS, variables are set at compile time.

Declaring CSS variables uses ( -- ).

```css
:root {
  --spacing: 10px;
}
```

To use CSS variables, you assign them with var.

```css
img {
  padding: var(--spacing);
}
```

querySelectorAll returns an Array-like Object. It looks like an Array, but it is a _NodeList_

The difference between an Array and a NodeList is the _Methods_ available for them.

_NodeList's do not have access to many of the methods Arrays do._

You _can_ convert NodeList's to Arrays if needed.

## Project 4

### .filter()

_Filter_ works by passing it a function. That function will loop over every item in an Array. The parameter passed to the function is used to decide wether or not you want to keep the item or not.

- Trick to displaying Arrays or Objects is using _console.table()_ instead of _console.log()._

### .map()

_Map_ takes in an Array, it does something with that Array, then returns a _NEW_ array, but of the same length.

### .sort()

_Sort_ works by taking in a function with 2 arguments, and if, for example _a > b_, then you return either 1, or -1.

### .reduce()

What _reduce_ does is, allow you to build something, on each element.
**Remember** to initialize your count variable after the code block.

You can call querySelectors again any existing DOM element.

```js
const category = document.querySelector('.mw-category');
const links = category.querySelectorAll('a');
```

**Remember**
querySelector will return a _NodeList_
There are a couple ways to turn a NodeList into an array.

const links = Array.from(category.querySelectorAll('a'));

**OR**
const links = [...category.querySelectorAll('a')];
The _Spread_ operator will take every item _out_ of something, (an iterable), and return it back into the containing array.

## Project 6

_Fetch_ returns a _Promise_. The way that you work with a _Promise_ is that you call _.then()_ against it. _.then()_ will return a "blob" of data.

The data that returns from _fetch_, doesn't know what type of data it is yet. The returned _Object_ has a _prototype_ method called _.json()_ attached to it.

```js
fetch(endpoint).then(blob => blob.json());
```

The _.json()_ returns _another Promise_, which you can call _.then()_ against.

```js
    .then(data => console.log(data));
```

The _.then()_ method of the _json()_ _Promise_, is what holds the usable raw data.

Can get a little hard to read, so break it into seperate lines.

```js
fetch(endpoint)
  .then(blob => blob.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

So the _fetch()_ sends out a request. It _then()_ returns in a _promise_. The data within that promise needs to be converted to _json_. The returned _promise_ Object has a _prototype_ method, _.json()_. That then returns yet _another promise_ which will contain the converted usable data.

> The Promise returned from fetch() wonâ€™t reject on HTTP error status even if the response is an HTTP 404 or 500. Instead, it will resolve normally (with ok status set to false), and it will only reject on network failure or if anything prevented the request from completing. --MDN

With the usable data, we may was to store it into an array.

let arr = [];

We "could" use a _let_ variable, but if you wanted to keep your variables a _const_ you can use the _spread_ operator to push the contents into the array. If you use just the _push()_ method, you would just be pushing an array INTO your array, which will give you a nested array. _Recommended_ to use _spread_ operator.

_some()_ will check if ANYTHING in your Array, meets what you're looking for.
